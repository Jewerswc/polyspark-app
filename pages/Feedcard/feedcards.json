Much of the Greensand Ridge lay water-logged; the vales were shackled to a wasteful three-course system of wheat, barley and fallow. Poor roads and poorer soils left the county peripheral to London’s voracious grain markets. It was, in a word, **under-performing**—just as the first factories of the Industrial Revolution were beginning to clamour for cheap, reliable food.  ",

With Brussels now cast off as the villain duly vanquished, MPs discovered they needed new antagonists, quickly replacing trade experts and economic commentators with convenient straw men, stuffed generously with misplaced metaphor.

Python has emerged as a leading choice for rapid development of backend services thanks to its ease of use, rich libraries, and growing ecosystem. However, misconceptions around Python-based backend scalability still persist. Some mistakenly suggest that Python services must be migrated entirely to stronger hardware (vertically scaled) as their demand grows. This could not be further from the truth. The reality is that Python services, designed correctly, can achieve industrial-strength resilience through horizontal scaling within a microservices architecture—even during periods of intense demand, without causing system meltdown.",
